    Execute a trading simulation against historical market data.
    
    This endpoint accepts a list of trading orders and simulates their execution
    against historical OHLCV data for the specified symbol and timeframe.
    
    The simulation uses deterministic fill logic:
    - Market orders are filled at the open price of the entry time bar
    - Limit orders are filled when price touches the entry price during or after entry time
    - Stop loss and take profit levels are evaluated in candle order (first touch wins)
    - Orders that don't meet entry conditions within the simulation window are discarded
    
    Returns detailed execution results including individual trade outcomes and
    performance metrics such as win rate, total PnL, and maximum drawdown.
